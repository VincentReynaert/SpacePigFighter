You have 2 skill points to share between offensif and defensif stuff. 
You may choose to boost your attack at the expense of the your defense or to boost your defense at the expense of the your attack. 
Unless you prefer to choose a well balanced build.

\begin{tabular}{|R{3,5cm}|C{3cm}|C{3cm}|}
\hline \rowcolor{lightgray} Build & Attack points & Defense points  \\
\hline Offensive & 2 & 0 \\
\hline Well balanced & 1 & 1 \\
\hline Defensive & 0 & 2 \\
