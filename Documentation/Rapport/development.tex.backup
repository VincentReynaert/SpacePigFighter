Each player plays when it is its turn.

Here is the UML diagram of the program:


\section{UML}

<insert here: UML>

Blue classes are abstract classes.\\
Green classes are interface.\\
Pink classes are enumeration.\\
Yellow classes are the two main classes from the 2 different parts of the game.\\


\section{Technical part: class description}

<insert here: brief class description>

\subsection{Set the game}

- set Player class for each player
- set Space class with 2 CubeEnvironment (1 for each player). Each CubeEnvironment is set with 3 meteorites and 1 spacecraft.
- set FightArea class with 2 pigs. Each pig is initialized with stuff selected by the player.


\subsection{The Space :}

It is composed by 2 CubeEnvironment created thanks to the 2 Player.


\section{Difficulties we encountered}

\subsection{Special action}

Special actions are very different. So we had to think our code so that it would be able to welcome each special action.
(We may had to modify our code ?)

\subsection{Exception}

We created an exception.
